# Linear Regression from Scratch README

This README provides an overview of the "Linear Regression from Scratch" project, including objectives, components, usage instructions, and key considerations.

## 1. Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model from scratch. Building a linear regression model from the ground up provides an understanding of the fundamental principles behind linear regression and its mathematical underpinnings.

## 2. Components
To create a linear regression model from scratch, the following components need to be implemented:

### 2.1 Linear Regression Model
- Implement the linear regression model, including parameters (weights and bias) initialization and prediction.

### 2.2 Loss Function
- Implement the loss function, typically mean squared error (MSE), to measure the model's performance.

### 2.3 Gradient Descent
- Implement the gradient descent optimization algorithm to update model parameters iteratively.

### 2.4 Data Preprocessing
- Implement data preprocessing steps, including feature scaling and bias term addition.

## 3. Usage Instructions
To use the linear regression model implemented from scratch, follow these steps:

### 3.1 Create an Instance of the Linear Regression Model
- Instantiate the linear regression model class, initializing the model's parameters (weights and bias).

### 3.2 Prepare Data
- Prepare your dataset, including feature extraction, data cleaning, and splitting into training and testing sets.

### 3.3 Training
- Use your training data to train the linear regression model. Implement the gradient descent algorithm to update model parameters and minimize the loss function.

### 3.4 Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained model on a separate testing dataset to assess its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

### 3.5 Prediction
- Use the trained linear regression model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## 4. Key Considerations
When implementing linear regression from scratch, consider the following:

- Learning Rate: Experiment with different learning rates to find an optimal value for gradient descent convergence.
- Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize input features to ensure smooth convergence during training.
- Bias Term: Add a bias term to the linear regression model to account for the intercept.
- Convergence Criteria: Implement a stopping criterion for gradient descent, such as a maximum number of iterations or a threshold for the change in the loss function.

## 5. Conclusion
Building a linear regression model from scratch is an educational project that provides insight into the core concepts of linear regression and gradient descent optimization. By following the usage instructions and considering key factors, you can create a functional linear regression model capable of making predictions based on input data. This project is a foundational step in understanding more complex machine learning models and algorithms.
